# Power-supply-design
 The goal of this Mini project was to design a DC power supply with adjustable output voltages without affecting the current levels. Proteus Software was used for the design.

REQUIREMENTS:
1) Main supply with switch: 230V, 50Hz 
2) Over current protection (fuse) 
3) Dual output
4) Operation mode 
	A. Independent
	B. Series 
	C. Parallel 
5) Output voltage range: 0-30V
6) Output current rate: 0-3A 
7) Over current indicator
